# Setting Up and Running the Blockchain Scripts

## Configuring `bitcoind` for Windows

1. **Download Bitcoin Core**

   - Visit the [official Bitcoin Core website](https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/) and download the Windows installer.
   - Install Bitcoin Core on your system.

2. **Configure `bitcoin.conf`**

   - Navigate to the Bitcoin data directory (e.g., `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin`).
   - Create or edit the `bitcoin.conf` file with the following content:
     ```conf
     rpcuser=divyam13
     rpcpassword=divyam1234
     rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
     server=1
     txindex=1
     regtest=1
     fallbackfee=0.0002
     ```
   - Save the file.

3. **Start `bitcoind` in Regtest Mode**

   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to start `bitcoind` in regtest mode:
     ```bash
     bitcoind -regtest -daemon
     ```

4. **Verify the Setup**

   - Use the following command to check if `bitcoind` is running:
     ```bash
     bitcoin-cli -regtest getblockchaininfo
     ```

5. **Mine 101 blocks for balance**
   - Use the following command to mine 101 blocks and generate a balance:
     ```bash
     bitcoin-cli -regtest generatetoaddress 101 <your_regtest_address>
     ```
   - Replace `<your_regtest_address>` with an address generated in regtest mode.

## Running the Python Scripts

1. **Install Dependencies**

   - Ensure Python is installed on your system.
   - Install the required Python library:
     ```bash
     pip install python-bitcoinrpc
     ```

2. **Run `1.py`**

   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the script directory:
     ```bash
     cd "c:\Users\divya\Desktop\Divyams_Computer_Folder\Python Files\Blockchain"
     ```
   - Run the script:
     ```bash
     python 1.py
     ```

3. **Run `2.py`**

   - Ensure the `addresses.txt` file is generated by `1.py`.
   - Execute the script:
     ```bash
     python 2.py
     ```

4. **Run `3.py`**
   - Ensure the wallet and addresses are properly set up.
   - Execute the script:
     ```bash
     python 3.py
     ```

## Notes

- Ensure `bitcoind` is running before executing any script.
- Use the `bitcoin-cli` commands to inspect the blockchain or debug issues.
- The scripts are designed for regtest mode, which is ideal for testing and development.
